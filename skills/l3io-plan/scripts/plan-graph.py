"""plan-graph.py -- every question about a plan that is a GRAPH question. Read-only.

Two modes, one graph:

    uv run {pm_status} dump-plan --state-root S | plan-graph.py analyze   -> findings JSON
    uv run {pm_status} dump-plan --state-root S | plan-graph.py phases    -> phases JSON

Both read `dump-plan` output on stdin and assemble no paths of their own, which is why they
can live here rather than inside pm-status.py.

WHY networkx AND NOT pm-status.py. The graph algorithms here were hand-written -- cycle
detection twice, longest path once, about 112 lines -- and networkx does all of it, plus
things that were simply absent: `transitive_reduction` for a redundant depends_on, and
`weakly_connected_components` for cohesion. It is NOT faster: measured on a 2000-story graph
it is slower than the hand-rolled version, and its import alone costs ~616 ms. That is
irrelevant at once-per-plan and would be ruinous in pm-status.py, which runs from 92 call
sites at ~0.21 s startup. So the dependency lives here and pm-status.py takes no graph
library at all. Do not "consolidate" them.

-- analyze ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT THIS IS FOR. `/l3io-plan reorg` proposes a better plan shape. The proposal itself needs
judgment -- which stories belong together, what is worth retiring -- and that is the agent's
half. This is the other half: every signal that can be MEASURED is measured here, so the
agent argues from evidence rather than from impression, and so the same tree produces the
same findings twice running. A proposal whose reasons cannot be re-derived is one nobody can
check.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not decide, rank, or recommend. Each finding
carries an id, the nodes involved, a measured value, and what that value suggests -- and
stops. In particular an ORPHAN (a story nothing depends on) is reported as a QUESTION, never
as a retirement finding: leaf work is very often the actual deliverable, and a tool that
scored "nothing depends on this" as "delete this" would be confidently wrong about the most
valuable story in the plan.

WHY IT TAKES JSON ON STDIN RATHER THAN READING THE TREE. Check 26 forbids any file under
`skills/` from assembling a state path; `pm-status.py` is the only thing that resolves a key
to a location. So the shape of the plan arrives via `pm-status.py dump-plan`, and this script
never touches the state tree:

    uv run {pm_status} dump-plan --state-root S | uv run plan-graph.py analyze

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS THE CRITICAL PATH. The spec's one objective is to reduce the cost of
discovering a problem late, measured as the longest dependency chain weighted by elapsed
hours: every hour on it is an hour nothing else can proceed through, and a late discovery
there invalidates the most downstream work. Everything else here is a guardrail.

    the example disagreed. It never mattered, because `l3io-execute`'s epic loop guards on
    `parallel_flag=true AND len(epics) > 1` independently, so the flag alone has never caused
    a concurrent dispatch of one epic. Making it mean the one thing it can act on removes the
