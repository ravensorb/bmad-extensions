"""reorg-analyze.py -- measure the shape of a plan. Read-only; emits findings, never advice.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. `/l3io-plan reorg` proposes a better plan shape. The proposal itself needs
judgment -- which stories belong together, what is worth retiring -- and that is the agent's
half. This is the other half: every signal that can be MEASURED is measured here, so the
agent argues from evidence rather than from impression, and so the same tree produces the
same findings twice running. A proposal whose reasons cannot be re-derived is one nobody can
check.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not decide, rank, or recommend. Each finding
carries an id, the nodes involved, a measured value, and what that value suggests -- and
stops. In particular an ORPHAN (a story nothing depends on) is reported as a QUESTION, never
as a retirement finding: leaf work is very often the actual deliverable, and a tool that
scored "nothing depends on this" as "delete this" would be confidently wrong about the most
valuable story in the plan.

WHY IT TAKES JSON ON STDIN RATHER THAN READING THE TREE. Check 26 forbids any file under
`skills/` from assembling a state path; `pm-status.py` is the only thing that resolves a key
to a location. So the shape of the plan arrives via `pm-status.py dump-plan`, and this script
never touches the state tree:

    uv run {pm_status} dump-plan --state-root S | uv run reorg-analyze.py

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS THE CRITICAL PATH. The spec's one objective is to reduce the cost of
discovering a problem late, measured as the longest dependency chain weighted by elapsed
hours: every hour on it is an hour nothing else can proceed through, and a late discovery
there invalidates the most downstream work. Everything else here is a guardrail.
