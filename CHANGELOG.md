# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. See [commit-and-tag-version](https://github.com/absolute-version/commit-and-tag-version) for commit guidelines.

## 1.0.1 (2026-05-16)

### Fixes

* **install:** silence `collectAgentsFromModuleYaml` and `writeCentralConfig` warnings during install by restructuring to the canonical BMad community module layout — `src/<module>/module.yaml` + `src/<module>/module-help.csv` at each module root, with skills nested as `src/<module>/bmad-l3io-<skill>/`. Agents declared in `module.yaml` now register correctly in the consumer's `config.toml` and user-scoped prompt keys file to `config.user.toml` as intended.

### Refactoring

* **infra:** rename all skills with `bmad-` prefix (SKILL-04 compliance): `bmad-l3io-pm-sprint-execute`, `bmad-l3io-pm-epic-execute`, `bmad-l3io-sec-agent-redteam`, `bmad-l3io-util-cleanup`. Slash commands change accordingly (`/bmad-l3io-pm-sprint-execute`, etc.).
* **infra:** move from flat `skills/` layout to per-module `src/<module>/` subtrees so PluginResolver Strategy 1 (root module files) fires cleanly for each plugin.
* **l3io-sec:** strip `name:` / `description:` frontmatter from `references/*.md` files (bmad-method validator rules WF-01/WF-02 reserve those fields for `SKILL.md` only). `CAPABILITIES.md` is now populated from the hand-curated `assets/CAPABILITIES-template.md` instead of being auto-generated from reference frontmatter.

### Notes

* Slash command names change from `/l3io-*` to `/bmad-l3io-*` — re-install in consumer repos picks up the new symlinks.
* Module names (`l3io-pm`, `l3io-sec`, `l3io-util`) and module codes are unchanged.

## 1.0.0 (2026-05-16)

Initial release of `bmad-l3io-extensions` — three installable BMad community modules for sprint/epic delivery, security review, and artifact organization.

### Features

* **l3io-pm**: sprint and epic execution orchestration
  * `bmad-l3io-pm-sprint-execute`: per-story prep → dev → code review → QA → fix loop, then closure (retro, clean release, adversarial, red team, UX, arch drift, issue triage). Sprint cannot close until all Critical/High findings are resolved.
  * `bmad-l3io-pm-epic-execute`: sprint grouping → sprint execution loop → epic-level closure (retro, parallel review batch, arch drift, functional completeness, issue triage). Epic cannot close until all Critical/High findings and undocumented drift are resolved.
* **l3io-sec**: memory-backed red team security agent (`bmad-l3io-sec-agent-redteam`) — adversarial review across five threat lenses (EXT, INS, CHA, ABU, DAR) with an AI poisoning cross-cut (AIP) and live cloud/platform best practices research (PBR). Persists a per-project sanctum with research cache.
* **l3io-util**: one-time artifact migration utility (`bmad-l3io-util-cleanup`) that reorganizes flat BMad artifacts into the standard `epic-XX/sprint-YY` folder layout with zero-padded names and reference reconciliation.

### Execution model

* Each phase runs in a fresh subagent — all state passes through disk, never through in-memory hand-off.
* Adaptive parallelism: defaults to sequential, hard cap of 4 concurrent subagents when independence and state safety can be verified.
* Quality gates: sprint and epic closure require all Critical and High severity findings to be resolved.
